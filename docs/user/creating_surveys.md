# Creating Surveys

Citizen Voice survey tool is an open-source map-based tool to collect data from citizens and other local actors. The tool allows for conventional types of survey questions, such as multiple choice, and map-based questions, including the possibility to add pins and draw polygons on a map.

The best approach to create such a survey(s) for your own projects is to run the application in a Docker container and create a superuser.

## Logging in as a Superuser in the Django Administration

These steps will walk you through to create a superuser for the Django application running inside the Docker container.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
<!-- - A running Django application managed by Docker Compose explained in [Step 5: Build and Run the Project](installation.md#step-5-build-and-run-the-project) of Installation Guide. -->

### 1. Access the Docker Container

First, you need to access the Docker container where your Django application is running. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec djangoapi /bin/bash
```
**Warning:** If you encounter an error stating that `/bin/bash` is not found, your container might be using a different shell. Try using `/bin/sh` instead.

### 2. Create a Superuser

Once you are inside the container, use Django's `createsuperuser management` command to create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to enter a username, email address, and password for the superuser.

### 3. Access the Django Admin Interface
After creating the superuser, you can access the Django admin interface by navigating to `http://localhost/api/admin` in your web browser. Use the credentials you set up in the previous step to log in.

#### Troubleshooting
**Verify Container Status:** Ensure that the container is running. You can check the status of your containers with:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
By following these steps, you should be able to create a superuser and access the Django admin interface in your Dockerized Django application.

## Creating a Survey as a Superuser in Django Administration

### 1. Access the Docker Container
1. Once you're in the repository, run `docker-compose --env-file .env up --build` to go to the local administrator page.
<!-- 2. Log in using your credentials creating in [Step 2: Create a Superuser](creating_surveys.md#step-2-create-a-superuser) -->
3. Upon successful login, you will see the Django administration dashboard as shown below:
